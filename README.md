# Monster Lab Tycoon

A Roblox tycoon game where players build and manage a monster laboratory, collecting resources and expanding their operations.

## üéÆ What's Been Built

### Core Systems

**Currency System**
- **BioCoins**: Primary currency for purchasing upgrades and equipment
- **DNA**: Special resource for advanced monster creation and research
- Real-time UI display with animated updates and visual feedback

**Resource Generation**
- Automated BioCoin generators that spawn collectible currency drops
- DNA generators for collecting genetic material
- Configurable generation rates and amounts

**Collection Mechanics**
- Touch-based collectors for both BioCoins and DNA
- Visual displays showing available resources to collect
- Automatic pickup system when players touch collector pads

**Purchase System**
- Buy buttons with configurable costs and currency requirements
- Support for purchasing generators and equipment
- Automatic deduction of currency and item placement

**UI Features**
- Sleek currency display with lab-themed styling
- Animated value updates with pulse effects
- Fade-in animations and modern UI design
- Responsive layout with rounded corners and glowing borders

### Technical Architecture

- **Client-Server Architecture**: Proper separation between client UI and server logic
- **Modular Design**: Each system is contained in separate script files
- **Project Structure**: Organized using Rojo with clear folder hierarchy
- **Event-Driven**: Uses Roblox's touch events and value change listeners

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- [Roblox Studio](https://create.roblox.com/landing)
- [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) for project synchronization

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone/Download the Project**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd MonsterLabTycoon
   ```

2. **Install Rojo** (if not already installed)
   - Follow instructions at [rojo.space](https://rojo.space/)

3. **Sync Project to Roblox Studio**
   ```bash
   rojo serve
   ```

4. **Open Roblox Studio**
   - Create a new place or open existing
   - Install the Rojo plugin if not already installed
   - Connect to the Rojo server (usually `localhost:34872`)

5. **Build the Game World**
   - Create the required workspace objects:
     - `BuyButtons` folder with buy button parts
     - `DNACollector` part with BillboardGui
     - `BioCoinCollector` part with BillboardGui
     - Place generator models in ServerStorage

6. **Test the Game**
   - Click "Play" in Roblox Studio
   - Walk around and interact with collectors and buy buttons

### Required Workspace Setup

The game expects these objects in the workspace:
- `BuyButtons/` - Folder containing purchasable items
- `DNACollector` - Part with touch detection for DNA collection
- `BioCoinCollector` - Part with touch detection for BioCoin collection
- Buy button parts with Config folders containing Cost, Target, and Currency values

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

### Current Architecture
- **Modular Scripts**: Each major system has its own script file
- **Event-Driven Design**: Uses Roblox's built-in events for interactions
- **Client-Server Model**: UI runs on client, game logic on server
- **Configuration-Based**: Buy buttons use config objects for easy balancing

### Code Organization
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/          # Client-side scripts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CurrencyUI.client.lua
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/          # Server-side scripts

```

### Known Issues
- Generators create IntValues in workspace (could be optimized)
- No persistence system (progress resets on server restart)
- Limited error handling for missing objects
